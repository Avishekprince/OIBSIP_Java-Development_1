# OIBSIP Java Development - Task 1: Online Reservation System 

##  Objective  
The objective of this project was to develop an **Online Reservation System** in Java.  
It simulates a simple railway ticket reservation system where users can **log in, book tickets, view reservations, and cancel tickets** through a console interface.

##  Steps Performed  
1. Implemented **user authentication** with a username and password system.  
2. Designed a **menu-driven interface** with options to:  
   - **Reserve a Ticket** (collect passenger details and store them).  
   - **View Reservation** (display booked ticket details).  
   - **Cancel Reservation** (delete ticket information).  
   - **Exit** the system.  
3. Used **classes and objects** to structure ticket and user details.  
4. Added validation to prevent booking without login and to ensure correct cancellation.  
5. Incorporated **loops, arrays/lists, and conditional statements** for smooth program flow.

##  Tools Used  
- **Java (Core Java)**  
- **JDK 8 or later**  
- **VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA**  

---

##  Outcome  
- Successfully created a **console-based reservation system**.  
- Learned about **object-oriented programming, user authentication, and file/console interaction**.  
- Improved problem-solving skills by implementing **real-world-like system logic**.
